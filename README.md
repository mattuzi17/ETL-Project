##  ETL Case Study Project

### Overview Report 

For this project NHL game data was used and extracted from CSV files. 
Using the Panadas library, the data was cleaned into dataframes which included select columns of data. 

The final database was loaded into pgAdmin with the joining of player stats and player info collections for a clean database with pertinent player statistics and information.
