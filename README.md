### Overview Report 


### Exctraction

### Transformation
Using the Panadas library, the data was cleaned into dataframes which included select columns of data :
(player info = id, first name, last name, and nationality)
(player stats = goals, assists, time on ice, shots)

### Load
The final database was loaded into pgAdmin with the joining of player stats and player info collections for a clean database with pertinent player statistics and information.
